## 🏎️ Core Directive

This is not a static resume. It is a **digital twin** of my professional capabilities, designed to demonstrate mastery in full-stack engineering, AI integration, and complex system visualization.

It serves a singular purpose: **To bridge the gap between embedded hardware engineering and modern web interactivity.**

## ⚡ System Capabilities

### 1. Neural Interface (J.A.R.V.I.S.)
An integrated LLM agent powered by **Google Gemini 2.5 Flash**.
- **Context-Aware**: Trained on my resume, skills, and specific F1 technical regulations.
- **Function Calling**: Can fetch live F1 standings, compare drivers, or filter my project database in real-time via the chat interface.
- **Local Fallback**: Includes a robust heuristic brain if the API connection is severed.

### 2. F1 Telemetry Hub
A specialized module for motorsport engineering analysis.
- **Aero Visualizer**: Custom HTML5 Canvas wireframe engine for interactive aerodynamic surface inspection.
- **Strategy Engine**: Monte Carlo-inspired logic for race strategy prediction (Tire Degradation vs. Pit Delta).
- **Pit Stop Sim**: React-based reflex testing tool modeled after actual F1 mechanic light systems.

### 3. "Reality Distortion" UI
Apple-inspired aesthetics meet Stark Industries utility.
- **Glassmorphism**: Heavy use of backdrop filters, alpha-blending, and noise textures.
- **Micro-Interactions**: Hover states, magnetic buttons, and scroll-triggered parallax.
- **Bento Grids**: Information density optimized for rapid visual scanning.

### 4. Mission Log (Events)
A dynamic tracking system for professional engagements.
- **Debrief Mode**: Detailed breakdowns of past conferences (SHPE, ALPFA) with key takeaways and strategic stats.
- **Upcoming Intel**: "Digital Ticket" style visuals for future mission objectives.

### 5. Network Synchronization
Background automation that simulates "syncing" with professional networks.
- **3D Digital Pass**: CSS3D transform-based holographic identity card.
- **Visual Feedback**: Matrix decoding effects and biometric scanning animations.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React 19, TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS (JIT Mode)
- **AI/ML**: Google GenAI SDK (`@google/genai`)
- **Motion**: CSS3 Animations, Intersection Observer API
- **Visualization**: SVG, HTML5 Canvas
